## Project Intro
Our project is based on the famous Japanese anime series Naruto Shippuden. Naruto is a Japanese anime television series based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga series of the same name. The story follows Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. Naruto Shippuden is considered the main series and consists of 500 twenty-minute episodes in total.

## Audience
If you are a fan of Naruto, our website helps you explore the anime world and characters in more depth. The websites includes a list of main characters with their pictures and short descriptions, a map visualizing their birthplaces, a statistics plot showing ability scores for some characters, and a battle matrix that displays the number of battles and their descriptions for the top fifty-five characters who fought the most throughout the series.
